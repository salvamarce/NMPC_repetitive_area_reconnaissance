# Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Repetitive Area Reconnaissance with a Multirotor Drone

__abstract__ This repo presents a possible solution to the problem of a repetitive reconnaissance mission in which a single multirotor drone must survey a given map by repetitively visiting different checkpoints. Several Points of Interest (POIs) are used to discretise the map and a time-varying attraction value is associated with each of them, that is related to the specific application. In that way, each POI has a different visiting priority each time. The proposed solution considers a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) approach that minimises the overall probability and considers several constraints related to the system dynamics and the environment (e.g., the presence of unknown obstacles). Possible applications are related to the research of gas leaks, area surveillance, and so on. The methodology is tested in both a realistic simulation environment and through experiments.
